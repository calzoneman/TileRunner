  TileRunner
------------

TileRunner is a 2D topdown game made in Java with use of LWJGL for rendering and input.  The gameplay concept is inspired by Luigi's Mansion - fight ghosts and explore maps in the dark searching for treasure.  Currently there is a map editing mode and a very basic normal mode.
